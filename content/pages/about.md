Hi, I’m **Muhammad** — an English teacher, web developer, and lifelong learner from Bangladesh.  
Over the past **six years**, I’ve helped students sharpen their English skills while continuously expanding my own expertise in **WordPress**, **cybersecurity**, and **e-commerce development**.

Here on my website, you’ll find:

- **English courses** — for both online and offline learners  
- **Web & WordPress services** — crafted for individuals and small businesses  
- **Tech projects & experiments** — where I explore and share what I build  

I believe in **learning, creating, and sharing knowledge that makes a real impact**.  
Let’s grow and build something meaningful together!
